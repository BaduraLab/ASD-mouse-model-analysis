# Moseq Analysis
Original analysis utilized developed by DattaLab (https://dattalab.github.io/moseq2-website/index.html)
1. AnalysisExtraction uses the progress.yaml fie, the index file and the modeloutput.p from the Moseq2 to generate preprocessed files to use for heatmap generation and transition matrix analysis. 
2. Heatmap Generation utilizes an index which incorporates additional factors to calculate heatmaps with significance analysis 
1. Transition matrix uses the transition matrix csvs generated by the analysis extraction to generate transition matrices for all groups.
